# WoltScript
the restaurants you want to order from on Wolt are closed? Here is a script that will check and notify you when it opens!

Either use a resturnat's built in alias or use the URL prefix e.g https://wolt.com/he/isr/tel-aviv/restaurant/ **vitrina-ibn-gvirol**

you are welcome the contribute to the alias list.
